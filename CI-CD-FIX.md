# 🔧 CI/CD Fix: Pnpm Cache Error

## ❌ Problem
The GitHub Actions workflow was failing with:
```
Error: Dependencies lock file is not found in /home/runner/work/ponder-caer/ponder-caer. 
Supported file patterns: package-lock.json,npm-shrinkwrap.json,yarn.lock
```

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **Updated GitHub Actions Workflow**
- Changed cache from `npm` to `pnpm`
- Fixed the order: Install pnpm first, then setup Node.js with pnpm cache
- Added explicit pnpm store caching for better performance

### 2. **Updated package.json**
- Added `packageManager` field to specify pnpm version
- This helps CI/CD environments auto-detect the correct package manager

## 🚀 Fixed Workflow Steps:

```yaml
- name: Install pnpm
  uses: pnpm/action-setup@v3
  with:
    version: 8
    run_install: false

- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '18'
    cache: 'pnpm'

- name: Get pnpm store directory
  shell: bash
  run: |
    echo "STORE_PATH=$(pnpm store path --silent)" >> $GITHUB_ENV

- name: Setup pnpm cache
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ${{ env.STORE_PATH }}
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-pnpm-store-${{ hashFiles('**/pnpm-lock.yaml') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-pnpm-store-
```

## 📋 What Was Changed:

1. **`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`**:
   - Fixed pnpm setup order
   - Added proper pnpm caching
   - Changed cache from 'npm' to 'pnpm'

2. **`package.json`**:
   - Added `"packageManager": "pnpm@8.15.0"`

## ✅ Now Ready to Deploy!

The workflow should now run successfully. To test:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix CI/CD pnpm cache issue"
git push origin use-cloud-db
```

## 🎯 Expected Workflow Flow:

1. ✅ Checkout code
2. ✅ Install pnpm
3. ✅ Setup Node.js with pnpm cache
4. ✅ Setup pnpm store cache
5. ✅ Install dependencies with `pnpm install`
6. ✅ Run type checking
7. ✅ Run linting
8. ✅ Build project
9. ✅ Deploy to EC2

The cache error should be resolved and deployment should proceed smoothly!
